# Assignment 1: Introduction to Data Visualization with UNESCO Heritage Sites
**Due Date:** September 18th, 11:59 PM

## Objective
In this assignment, you’ll get started with Tableau to explore and visualize data. Using the UNESCO World Heritage Sites (2021) dataset, you will create basic visualizations to answer specific questions and propose your own questions for further exploration. This assignment will help you practice creating simple visualizations and interpreting the results.

## Instructions

### Getting Started with Tableau
- Install [Tableau for students](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students), it is free.
- You can watch a [Tableau Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uBtK6j_QgA&ab_channel=LearnitTraining)
- The dataset you will be using contains columns such as site name, country, year of designation, and site category (Cultural, Natural, or Mixed). You can directly access the dataset via [this link](https://github.com/SIAT-IAT-355/A1-Tableau-Intro/blob/main/data/UNESCO_Sites_Data.csv). The dataset is also available in the Canvas Files section and on the Discord server.
- Download the dataset and open it in Tableau. Take some time to explore the Tableau interface, including drag-and-drop functionality, chart types, and the data pane.

### 1. Answer the Following Questions Using Visualizations:

#### Questions:
1. **Which country has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites?**
   - Create a **bar chart** showing the number of sites in each country.
   
2. **What type of site is most prevalent? Cultural, Natural, and Mixed?**
   - Create a **pie chart** to show the number of Cultural, Natural, and Mixed sites worldwide.
   
3. **Which decade had the highest number of new site designations?**
   - Use a **line or bar chart** to show the number of sites designated per decade.

> **Tip:** Don’t worry if this is your first time using Tableau. Focus on practicing how to build simple visualizations step by step. Ask questions on Discord :)

### 2. Reflect on Your Findings
- After you create each visualization, take a moment to describe what you observe. 
- Write a brief summary (2-3 sentences) of the patterns or insights you can identify from each chart or map. For example, you might notice which countries have the most heritage sites or trends over time.

### 3. Propose Two Questions of Your Own
- Now that you have explored the dataset, think of **two additional questions** that you can answer using Tableau.
- For each question:
  - Clearly state the question you want to explore.
  - Create a visualization to answer that question using Tableau (tip: you might create a few different map visualizations).
  - Write a brief explanation (2-3 sentences) of what your visualization shows and why it’s important or interesting.

### 4. Submission Instructions

- You need a summary document to write your responses in and place images of visualizations.
- Place your Tableau Workbook (`.twb` or `.twbx`) and a summary document (PDF) inside a folder.
- In your summary document, please include **a screenshot or image of each visualization**.
- Zip the folder and upload the zipped file to the **Assignment 1** submission page on Canvas.
- Ensure that your Tableau Workbook and summary document are correctly named as:
  - **Tableau Workbook:** `IAT355_Assignment1_FirstNameLastName.twbx`
  - **Summary Document:** `IAT355_Assignment1_FirstNameLastName.pdf`

## Some tips:
- Start simple! Focus on learning how to create basic bar charts, pie charts, and maps.
- Use Tableau’s drag-and-drop interface to experiment with different chart types.
- Don’t be afraid to explore different ways to present the data—this is your opportunity to get comfortable with Tableau.
