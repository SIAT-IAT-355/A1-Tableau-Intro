# Assignment 1: Introduction to Data Visualization with UNESCO Heritage Sites
**Due Date:** September 23rd, 11:59 PM

## Objective
In this assignment, you’ll get started with Tableau to explore and visualize data. Using the UNESCO World Heritage Sites (2021) dataset, you will create basic visualizations to answer specific questions and propose your own questions for further exploration. This assignment will help you practice creating simple visualizations and interpreting the results.

## Instructions

### 1. Getting Started with Tableau
- The dataset you will be using is located in the [data](https://github.com/SIAT-IAT-355/A1-Tableau-Intro/tree/main/data) folder of this repository. It contains columns such as site name, country, year of designation, and site category (Cultural, Natural, or Mixed).
- You can directly access the dataset via [this link](https://github.com/SIAT-IAT-355/A1-Tableau-Intro/blob/main/data/UNESCO_Sites_Data.csv).
- Download the dataset from the repository and open it in Tableau. Take some time to explore the Tableau interface, including drag-and-drop functionality, chart types, and the data pane.

### 2. Answer the Following Questions Using Visualizations:

#### Questions:
1. **Which country has the most UNESCO World Heritage Sites?**
   - Create a **bar chart** showing the number of sites in each country.
   
2. **What is the distribution of Cultural, Natural, and Mixed sites?**
   - Create a **pie chart** to show the number of Cultural, Natural, and Mixed sites worldwide.
   
3. **Which decade had the highest number of new site designations?**
   - Use a **line chart** to show the number of sites designated per decade.
   
4. **Where are the UNESCO World Heritage Sites located globally?** _(This question carries additional points)_
   - Create a **map** showing the locations of UNESCO sites. Use different colors to distinguish between Cultural, Natural, and Mixed sites.


> **Tip:** Don’t worry if this is your first time using Tableau. Focus on practicing how to build simple visualizations step by step.

### 3. Analyze Your Findings
- After you create each visualization, take a moment to describe what you observe. 
- Write a brief summary (2-3 sentences) of the patterns or insights you can identify from each chart or map. For example, you might notice which countries have the most heritage sites or trends over time.

### 4. Propose Two Questions of Your Own
- Now that you have explored the dataset, think of **two additional questions** that you can answer using Tableau.
- For each question:
  - Clearly state the question you want to explore.
  - Create a visualization to answer that question using Tableau.
  - Write a brief explanation (2-3 sentences) of what your visualization shows and why it’s important or interesting.

### 5. Submission Instructions

1. **Create a Personal Repository:**
   - On your GitHub account, create a new private repository named **`IAT355_Assignments_FirstNameLastName`**. This will be where you submit all your assignments for this course.

2. **Organize Your Repository:**
   - Inside your repository, create a folder named **`Assignment1`**.
   - Place your Tableau Workbook (`.twb` or `.twbx`) and a summary document (Markdown or PDF) inside this folder.
   - Ensure the folder structure looks like this:
     ```
     IAT355_Assignments_FirstNameLastName/
     └── Assignment1/
         ├── IAT355_Assignment1_FirstNameLastName.twbx
         └── IAT355_Assignment1_FirstNameLastName.md
     ```

3. **Push Your Work to GitHub:**
   - After organizing your files locally, push them to your GitHub repository:
     ```
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add Assignment 1 Submission"
     git push origin main
     ```

4. **Submit the GitHub Repository Link:**
   - Once you’ve pushed your work to GitHub, send an email that includes the link to your repository’s main page to **both** of the following email addresses:
     - alireza_karduni@sfu.ca
     - koosha_kabiri@sfu.ca
   - Example: `https://github.com/YourUsername/IAT355_Assignments_FirstNameLastName`
   - For the following assignments, we will have access to your repository, and it will not be necessary to send us the link again.

5. **Ensure Privacy Settings:**
   - Make sure your repository is set to **Private** to maintain your privacy.

## Guidance for Beginners:
- Start simple! Focus on learning how to create basic bar charts, pie charts, and maps.
- Use Tableau’s drag-and-drop interface to experiment with different chart types.
- Don’t be afraid to explore different ways to present the data—this is your opportunity to get comfortable with Tableau.
